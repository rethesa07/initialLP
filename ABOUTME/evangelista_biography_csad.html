			<p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Rethesa G. 
			Evangelista, the eldest child of Renato Evangelista and Maria Theresa Gaila<sup>1</sup>. My father's ancestors 
			are from the province of Quezon, and my mother's ancestors are from the province of Pangasinan<sup>2</sup>. On 
			the first of January 1993, I was born in a public hospital in Quezon City<sup>3</sup>. My younger brother's name 
			is Remar, and he is one year younger than me<sup>4</sup>. We had been living in the house of my grandmother, my 
			mother's mother, in Quezon City since I was born, along with my uncle Ronald Gaila and his family<sup>5</sup>. 
			We are a big family living in one house, and my cousins and I had such a close bond when we were 
			younger<sup>6</sup>. At the age of four, I enrolled in the nursery level of the Daycare Center in our 
			community<sup>7</sup>. I can still picture myself participating in some of the activities that my teacher is 
			organizing<sup>8</sup>. Some instances include wearing my Halloween costume to our Halloween party, dancing 
			<q>Pandanggo sa Ilaw</q> as the intermission number, and singing a Jaya <q>The Soul Diva</q> song as my talent 
			piece for the competition<sup>9</sup>. I gained a lot from being active in school since I was able to receive 
			the honor of being the nursery <b><em>Salutatorian</em></b><sup>10</sup>. And I am overly happy and proud 
			because the year after I received that honor, my brother, who is also a student at that Daycare Center, was 
			named <em>Valedictorian</em> when he completed kindergarten<sup>11</sup>. I enjoyed it so much when I was in 
			nursery and kindergarten since I was able to do other things aside from studying during those years despite 
			being shy in front of different people<sup>12</sup>. That period, when I was in elementary school, was both a 
			happy and, at the same time, a heartbreaking part of my early life<sup>13</sup>. Every day I looked forward to 
			seeing my classmates and spending time with them while we played and studied<sup>14</sup>. When I was in 
			second grade, I became involved in a private group that helps less fortunate students like me by sponsoring us 
			with money and school supplies<sup>15</sup>. Through that organization, <b>I was also exposed to a number of 
			spiritually oriented activities that have helped me develop and strengthen my relationship with the Higher 
			Power</b><sup>16</sup>. Not only does this group greatly assist me financially, but it also <i>positively 
			influences my character</i><sup>17</sup>. When I was confronted with the biggest struggle our family would ever 
			face, I would say that this also helped me<sup>18</sup>. When my parents' relationship failed, me and my younger 
			brother were severely impacted<sup>19</sup>. We struggled with this issue all the way through high 
			school<sup>20</sup>.</blockquote></blockquote></p><br><br>

		<div class="paragraph">
			<p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my elementary 
			education in 2005 at Diosdado P. Macapagal Elementary School, which is close to our home<sup>1</sup>. After that, 
			I began to live the life of a high school student when I enrolled at Carlos L. Albert High School, where my 
			mother completed her secondary education<sup>2</sup>. My new school is also in Quezon City, but it is farther 
			away from my house than my elementary school was<sup>3</sup>. To get to my new school, I will need to take a 
			jeep, and this will be the first time I'll be commuting without my parents<sup>4</sup>. <b>I am filled with mixed 
			emotions as I begin on my new journey</b><sup>5</sup>. I am a little sad since I will be separated from several of 
			my close friends from my former school because they chose to enroll in another school<sup>6</sup>. But I'm also 
			happy since I saw familiar faces in my new school who were my batchmates in my old school<sup>7</sup>. At the 
			very least, I can say that I am not a total stranger here because I already know a few people<sup>8</sup>. My 
			first year was not as simple as I had expected<sup>9</sup>. I had a difficult time adjusting, particularly in 
			the lessons, because it is more difficult than the elementary level<sup>10</sup>. <em>It was also during my first 
			year that my mother gave birth to my new younger brother, Mart</em><sup>11</sup>. I'd say it was a huge difficulty 
			for me since, while my mother was still in the hospital, I was left to handle many household duties alone 
			because my father was too busy to help, especially with the hospital costs that needed to be paid<sup>12</sup>. 
			<i>Despite the challenges we had at the time, we managed to overcome them</i>, and after how many days in the 
			hospital, my mother and brother were able to return home safely<sup>13</sup>. It was in my second year that I 
			was able to improve my grades in comparison to my previous year<sup>14</sup>. Every grading period, our school 
			honors the Top Three students in each section as well as the students who set an excellent example by 
			maintaining both high academic standing and polite behavior; they were named <q>Model Boy</q> and <q>Model 
			Girl</q>, respectively<sup>15</sup>. Starting that school year, <b><em>I was able to rank in the Top Three 
			and earn the title of Model Girl in my class</em></b><sup>16</sup>. I was able to hold onto that position 
			through my fourth year<sup>17</sup>. <i>Receiving certificates of appreciation every grading period since then 
			has been a delight for me</i><sup>18</sup>. My life has revolved around studying since I was a young child, 
			so when I graduated from high school, I made a promise to myself that I would finish my studies before 
			dating<sup>19</sup>. My parents completely separated during my fourth year of high school, and I graduated 
			from high school in 2009<sup>20</sup>.</blockquote></blockquote></p><br><br>

				<p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I have a serious 
				problem going to college because we can't actually afford it<sup>1</sup>. Fortunately, I have my aunt, who 
				is my father's sister, to help assist me financially as I start college<sup>2</sup>. I started my first year 
				at <em>Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology</em> the same year I graduated from high 
				school, in 2009, with the program <em>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</em><sup>3</sup>. I'm both excited 
				and anxious at the same time about this new adventure because we're struggling financially<sup>4</sup>. 
				College was more difficult than high school, especially in terms of the lessons that had to be discussed and 
				the activities that had to be completed<sup>5</sup>. But despite that, I would still say that I had a good 
				time, especially when we had the opportunity to camp in Los Baños Laguna's Mount Makiling as part of the 
				training for the NSTP CWTS course<sup>6</sup>. It was a special moment for me because I got to try <i><q>zip 
				lining, rappelling, and other physical activities</i></q> there for the first time<sup>7</sup>. When I was 
				about to start second year, my mother had already left us with another guy, and I was upset since I was 
				also worried about how to help my brother Remar as he started college<sup>8</sup>. <em>My brother passed 
				the UPCAT exam</em> but at Los Baños Laguna, and he is very eager to enroll there, and as a sister, I want 
				to help him in this endeavor<sup>9</sup>. After finishing the first semester of my second year of school, 
				I chose to stop because I am already struggling with the numerous duties our parents left us<sup>10</sup>. 
				I then began looking for work to be able to meet our daily necessities<sup>11</sup>. I had my first job 
				as a <em><q>Sales Representative</q> in 2011</em>, and it took me a long time to get one because I still 
				had no knowledge or experience working<sup>12</sup>. But I couldn't force myself to continue working at 
				just one job<sup>13</sup>. Along the road, I had a variety of jobs; in total, I had five, including <i>sales 
				representative, sales assistant, data encoder, cashier, and accounting staff</i><sup>14</sup>. I cannot 
				force myself to stay in any work since I am constantly hungry to advance in each career I take on, and in 
				order to do so, I must complete college<sup>15</sup>. Even if it's difficult for me to save money for 
				education, my aspirations to continue my studies have never faded<sup>16</sup>. No matter how many years 
				have passed, <b>I continue to believe that it will happen and I always include it in my prayers</b>
				<sup>17</sup>. My brother Remar graduated from college in 2019, the same year he advised me to start 
				looking for a university so I could finally complete my studies<sup>18</sup>. <em>I was able to return 
				to school in 2021 at the age of 28</em>, and <b>I enrolled in the University of the East's Bachelor of 
				Science in Computer Science degree</b> and currently in the second semester of my second-year 
				level<sup>19</sup>. <i><b><q>Dreams can truly become a reality if you pray and believe that they 
				will</q></b></i><sup>20</sup>.</p><br><br>
