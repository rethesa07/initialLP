			<p><blockquote>Back when computers and cellphones were not as widely available, watching television was a 
			popular pastime. I used to enjoy watching my favorite TV series back then whenever I had free time as a child. 
			I enjoy watching comedy shows simply because they're fun. Despite the difficulties of life, it made me feel better. 
			Korean dramas were also among my favorites because the stories were creative and the actors were so talented 
			that even if no lines were spoken, the emotion required in the scene was perfectly portrayed. I am always amazed 
			by how Korean artists act. Reality TV is also on my list since it shows life as it is in reality. Because I 
			believe there is always a lesson to be learned from everyone's life narrative.</blockquote></p>
