			<p><blockquote>One of my favorite activities when I just want to unwind from the stresses of everyday life is 
			watching movies. Action movies have always been a favorite of mine to watch, especially ones with female leads. 
			I enjoy seeing women who perform well in fighting. I get the impression that I can also do it ;). And as a woman, 
			I support the empowerment of women. I also enjoy drama and romance, such as those seen in inspirational or 
			true-to-life movies. I enjoy romantic films because I enjoy the "kilig" feeling that certain scenes give me.
