			developed a variety of hobbies throughout the years that are both mentally and physically 
			challenging<sup>3</sup>. For instance, <q><em>I enjoy going on long walks</em></q> and consider them to be my 
			exercise<sup>4</sup>. Usually, my brother and I do it<sup>5</sup>. I frequently look for new pathways to explore 
			while out for a walk, and I take my time to enjoy the surroundings<sup>6</sup>. I have a variety of hobbies that 
			allow me to unwind, focus, and fully enjoy life<sup>7</sup>. One of them is <q><em>watching movies</em></q> that 
			relax me and take me to different worlds and stories<sup>8</sup>. I find that watching movies helps me unwind 
			after a long day and forget about the problems of daily life<sup>9</sup>. Given my growing appreciation for 
			movies, I actually made a list of every film or television show I've seen in the past year<sup>10</sup>. I also

			free time, I like to engage in these activities because they enable me to <b><i>find balance and contentment in 
			my personal life</i></b><sup>16</sup>.Hobbies are also advantageous in other ways, such as boosting 
			self-confidence, inspiring creativity, and learning new skills that will be useful in the
